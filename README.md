<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](http://(https://github.com/[thigraa]/[my_button_component_app]/blob/[master]/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? A Demo Page where you can find different types of buttons, with its types and colours
- What was your experience? My experience was a bit bittersweet, because it's my first time developing web with Flutter and i discovered some pros and cons in it
- What have you learned/improved? I've improved in component creation and styles. I've also learned that you have to commit your projects guys. I nearly lost all the progress. Luckly, I had VSCode Timeline, that saved my life. :)
- Your wisdom? If you have to make a lot of styles conditions in flutter use Map instead of regular ifs :)
